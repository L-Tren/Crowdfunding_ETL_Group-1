Getting started
---
An anaconda dev environment with python version 3.7 was used to edit the notebook file and perform all operations.

The two methods used to edit code were:

  1. VSCode with the Jupyter extension (ms-toolsai.jupyter) & Python extension(ms-python.python).
  
  2. A Jupyter Lab IDE session started with the following command line through git terminal:
   
    jupyter jab

The following python dependencies were imported:

    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np

In addition to these dependencies we've limited the column width in the dataframe outputs to 400 pixels with the following line:

    pd.set_option('max_colwidth', 400)
